Beyond R's basic graphics system: lattice and ggplot2

* Contents
- docs :: Some lattice and ggplot2 related documents. These documents cannot be found on my github
          repo but the corresponding links are presented inside the slides. 
- graphics :: R graphics
- /report :: Slides (PDF-, Org- and TeX-files)
- /src :: R code

* Understanding and running R code
The R source code can be found in =/src=. For each slide, R code is separated by a marker which
starts with "## [[file:e:" and can help you to find the corresponding slide. This may look ugly to
you but (a) the symbols indicate that these lines are commented out and harmless and (even more
important) (b) are an essential part of my work flow and cannot be removed.
